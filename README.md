State Space Analysis (Deterministic and Stochastic System)

## Deterministic system
In this study, we explore the dynamics of a neural network model comprising excitatory and inhibitory populations. Inspired by pioneering research, we investigate the steady states, trajectories, and stability properties of the system. By employing isoclines, flow fields, and bifurcation diagrams, we uncover distinct regions of behavior for varying synaptic weights (w). The Jacobian matrix analysis aligns theoretical predictions with empirical observations, validating the stability analysis. This research enhances our understanding of neural network dynamics, contributing valuable insights into their information processing mechanisms.

## Stochastic System
This repository presents an in-depth exploration of the dynamics of a stochastic neural network model, offering valuable insights into the interplay between noise and neural activity. Neural systems are inherently subject to stochastic influences, and understanding their behavior under such conditions is crucial for uncovering the complexities of brain function. Through simulations and analyses, we investigate the stability, spectral characteristics, and first-passage time of the system, providing a multifaceted view of its behavior.
